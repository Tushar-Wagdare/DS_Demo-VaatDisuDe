# Vaat Disu De

## Description

This repository contains my DS Demo "Vaat Disu De" using OpenGL(FFP) made while learning OpenGL using C++. "Vaat Disu De" is a story of a small honeybee and its mother as they search for a new home after their forest habitat is destroyed. Despite the challenges, their bond and determination shine through in this uplifting tale.

## Folder Structure

The repository structure is organized as follows:

*   `Headers`: Contains C++ header files (.h). These files likely define classes, structures, and function prototypes used in the project.
*   `Song`: Contains audio files (likely .mp3, .wav, etc.) used for background music or sound effects.
*   `Texture`: Contains image files (.png, .jpg, etc.) used as textures for rendering objects and scenes.
*   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore, such as build outputs and temporary files.
*   `OGL.cpp`: Main C++ source code file. Contains the core program logic and likely the `main()` function.
*   `OGL.rc`: Resource file.  This Windows resource file is used to embed application icons, version information, and other resources into the executable.
*   `build.bat`: Batch script for building the project on Windows. Automates the compilation process.
*   `git_push.bat`: Batch script for pushing changes to the Git repository.  A convenience script for streamlining Git operations.
